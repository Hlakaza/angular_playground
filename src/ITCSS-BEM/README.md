## Settings

Global variables, site-wide settings, config switches, etc.

## Tools

Site-wide mixins and functions.

## Generic

Low-specificity, far-reaching rulesets (e.g. resets).

## Elements

Unclassed HTML elements (e.g. `a {}, blockquote {}, address {}`).

## Objects

Objects, abstractions, and design patterns (e.g. `.o-layout {}`).

## Components

Discrete, complete chunks of UI (e.g. `.c-carousel {}`).

## Utilities

High-specificity, very explicit selectors. Overrides and helper classes (e.g. `.u-hidden {}`).
